Hello and welcome to the personal website of Mihaly Himics. I'm a mathematician and agricultural economics researcher. I'm currently with JRC-IPTS; an independent research institute of the European Commission. In the last eight years or so I've been doing economic modelling. Though the scale has been increased over the years. Nowadays I'm working almost exclusively with [CAPRI](http://www.capri-model.org): a giant optimization model with several thousand equations. In late 2010 I was enrolled in the PhD programme of [Uni Bonn](http://www.ilr1.uni-bonn.de/agpo/agpo_e.htm) in my effort to formalize my experience in agricultural economics (and to work with the fantastic people there...). 

On this website you can find updates on my current research activites  and references to my published works.

For further info and for my off-topic projects visit [my blog](http://trialsolution.wordpress.com) or take a look at [my github page](http://github.com/trialsolution).
