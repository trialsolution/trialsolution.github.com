Hello and welcome to the personal website of Mihaly Himics. I'm a mathematician and (wannabe) agricultural economist. I'm currently with JRC-IPTS; an independent research institute of the European Commission. In the last eight years or so I've been doing economic modelling. Though the size and coverage of the models have been increased over the years. Nowadays I'm working almost exclusively with [CAPRI](http://www.capri-model.org). In late 2010 I was enrolled in the PhD programme of [Uni Bonn](http://www.ilr1.uni-bonn.de/agpo/agpo_e.htm) following my continous efforts to get deep into agricultural economics (and to work with the fantastic people there...). 

On this website you can find updates on my [current research activites](news.md) and also a list of my [publications](publications.md).

You might also want to visit [my blog](http://trialsolution.wordpress.com) or to take a look at [my github page](http://github.com/trialsolution).
