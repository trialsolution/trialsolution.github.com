<h3>About</h3>
I'm a mathematician and PhD candidate in agricultural economics. 
With this website I have two objectives. On the one hand it provides references to my <a href="references">projects and publications</a>. 
On the other hand it serves as a research notebook with posts covering my <a href="notebook">current research activites</a>.
