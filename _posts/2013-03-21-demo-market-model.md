### Short version of the CAPRI market model


Today I started the _shortcapri_ project on github. It is about developing a simple, demonstrative 
example for the CAPRI market model. I tried to create the simplest structure possible, making as many simplifications as I could: the current structure has only two products, three regions, no processing and no feeds, etc. 

More info and download are available on the projects [web page](http://trialsolution.github.com/shortcapri/).
