CAPRI-RD aims to investigate rural development policies; and those usually have an impact much wider than only the agricultural production activities. Therefore partial equilibrium models like CAPRI do not perform well in simulating the economic effects of rural development policies. Global equilibrium models are more adequate to this purpose. To combine both approaches, a layer of regional CGE models are to be developed and linked to CAPRI in this project.

There are other developments included: rural development subsidies database, outlier detection, etc.
